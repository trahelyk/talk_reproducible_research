## Kyle who?

* MS in Biostatistics from OHSU in June 2014
* 2016 – Now: Statistician at OHSU Department OB/GYN
* 2014 – 2016: Statistician at OHSU Department of Surgery
* 2014 - Now: Statistician with the Biostatistics & Design Program
* 2013 – 2014: Data manager at the VA 
* 2004 – 2013: Data manager in industry

## Why I act this way
	
* I've been writing code since I was 8; I see all this through the eyes of a programmer.
* I'm deeply committed to R.
* I'm cautiously optimisitc about the Hadley Wickham/tidyverse/RStudio movement.
* It's all about literate programming.

## (with applications in R)

This talk will focus on applications in R.

* I think implementations in SAS and Stata are clunky and immature. 
* SPSS, as far as I can tell, isn't even really trying. 
* Also, because R is just how I roll.

# What is research? 
What is not resarch?

## Things that are not research
* Journal article
* Talk at a conference
* Poster
* Slide deck
* Book
* Web site

	
These things are not research; they are advertising for research. Research is "the full software environment, code, and data that produced the results." 

(Claerbout 1992)

## Gold standard: Replicability

## Gold standard: Replicability

* The research includes enough stuff that a different researcher can follow the same procedures in a new sample and come up with the same results.
* Hard to do if the original study used the whole population or if there isn't funding to replicate the results.
* Perhaps journals are culpable here because "statistically significant, novel, and theoretically tidy results are published more easily than null, replication, or perplexing results" (Miguel et al). 

## Next-best thing: Reproducibility

When replicability is not feasible, reproducibility is a minimum standard for judging scientific claims.

(Peng 2011)

The research includes enough stuff that a different researcher can follow the same procedures in the same sample and come up with the same results.

## Why is reproducibility important?
* Reproducible does not mean results aren't wrong.
* Reproducible does not mean results are credible. 
* Reproducibility does not mean results are not sensitive to methods.
* But it exposes these things so peers can spot them and improve scientific consensus.

## Why is reproducibility important?
> - If you know somebody else might look, your code might magically become more organized
> - Improves collaboration
> - Who is your most important collaborator?
> - Revise and resubmit. Make it easier for Future You.

## Traditional (non-reproducible) workflow 

<div class="centered">
<img src="gfx/workflow1.png" alt="Traditional workflow" width="700px"/>
</div>

## Reproducible workflow 

<div class="centered">
<img src="gfx/workflow2.png" alt="Reproducible workflow" width="700px"/>
</div>

## Minimum components of a reproducible workflow
* Data
* Code
* Software (including versions)
* Presentation (manuscript, slide deck, or whatever)
* Documentation that explains how all the pieces are connected
	
## Tools
  * Data:
    + X Drive
    + Data dictionary 
        + Names of data files and what they contain
        + Columns used in analysis
        + Names and definitions of data columns
        + Value labels and coding conventions for categorical variables
        
## Tools
  * Code:
    + R
  *	Software:
    + R
    + R packages
    + Code comments or Word document to keep track of versions
    
## Tools    
  * Presentation:
    + MS Word
    + MS Powerpoint
    + Whatever
  * Documentation:
    + MS Word
    + Code comments

## More ideal components of a reproducible workflow
* Data
* Code
* Software (including versions)
* Presentation (manuscript, slide deck, or whatever)
* Documentation that explains how all the pieces are connected
* An elegant way to package all of this
	
## Tools
* Data:
    + Git/GitHub
    + Make files and R make-like files
    + Data dictionary
* Code: 
    + RStudio (is anybody using R without RStudio?)
    + tidyverse
    + Master script
	  
## Tools
* Software:
	  + R
	  + packrat
* Presentation:
	  + knitr
	  + RMarkdown
	  + LaTeX
* Documentation:
	  + knitr
	  + RMarkdown
    + Git/GitHub

## A literate document

```{r echo=FALSE, results="hide" , message=FALSE} 
library ("JM")
library("survminer")
library("survival")
data("aids.id")
```

```{r coxmodel , echo=TRUE, results="hide" , message=FALSE}
coxAids <- coxph(Surv(Time,death) ~ drug + gender + CD4 + AZT, 
                 data=aids.id) 
```

We examined survival time among `r length(aids.id$patient)` AIDS patients using a Cox proportional hazards model , adjusting for drug treatment group , gender , baseline CD4 lymphocyte count , and history of Zidovudine (AZT) tolerance or
failure.

Significant predictors included baseline CD4 lymphocyte count
(HR: `r round(exp(coef(coxAids)[3]), 3)`,
95\% CI: `r round(exp(confint(coxAids)),3)[3,]`)
and history of AZT failure (HR: `r round(exp(coef(coxAids )[4]) , 3)`, 95\% CI: `r round(exp(confint(coxAids)),3)[4,]`).

## File management
* Working folders
* Relative paths
* Getwd(), and setwd()
* RStudio projects

## Thanks
I borrowed the concept for the workflow figures from Ben Chan, Stephanie Renfro, and Thomas Meath at the Center for Health Systems Effectiveness (CHSE). They gave a talk on reproducible research with knitr on July 22, 2015.
