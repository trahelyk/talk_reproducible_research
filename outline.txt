This talk will focus on applications in R, because implementations in SAS and Stata are clunky and immature and SPSS, as far as I can tell, isn't even really trying. Also, because I use R and I think it's nifty.

Research presentations:
	* Journal article
	* Book
	* Web site
	* Slide deck
	
These things are not research; they are advertising for research. Research is "the full software environment, code, and data that produced the results." (Claerbout, 1992)

Gold standard: Replicability
The research includes enough stuff that a different researcher can follow the same procedures in a new sample and come up with the same results.

Hard to do if the original study used the whole population or if there isn't funding to replicate the results.

Perhaps journals are culpable here because "statistically significant, novel, and theoretically tidy results are published more easily than null, replication, or perplexing results" (Miguel et al).

Next-best thing: Reproducibility
Peng: When replicability is not feasible, reproducibility is a minimum standard for judging scientific claims.

The research includes enough stuff that a different researcher can follow the same procedures in the same sample and come up with the same results.

---
Why is reproducibility important?
Reproducible does not mean results aren't wrong.
Reproducible does not mean results are credible. 
Reproducibility does not mean results are not sensitive to methods.
But it exposes these things so peers can spot them and improve scientific consensus.

Why is reproducibility important?
Improves collaboration
Who is your most important collaborator? (Future You)
If you know somebody else might look, your code might magically become more organized
You could get hit by a bus; in that case, we will obviously be most concerned about moving forward with your research. 
Revise and resubmit. Make it easier for Future You.

Minimum components of a reproducible workflow
	* Data
	* Code
	* Software (including versions)

More ideal components of a reproducible workflow
	* Data
	* Code
	* Software (including versions)
	* Presentation (manuscript, slide deck, or whatever)
	* Documentation that explains how all the pieces are connected
	* An elegant way to package all of this

Thanks
I borrowed the concept for the workflow figures from Ben Chan, Stephanie Renfro, and Thomas Meath at the Center for Health Systems Effectiveness (CHSE).
